## Research Project and Aims

AI is being used to generate manipulative political information and deceitful deepfakes which can be used to incite hate and spread misinformation. Questions are therefore being raised on whether AI-generated content influences voting behaviour and election outcomes such that AI poses a threat to the trust and integrity of democratic political institutions. To better understand these concerns, my MPhil research question asks:

\begin{quote} \textit{Does exposure to AI-generated news increase affective polarisation?} \end{quote}

My research also seeks to investigate the role AI plays on trust as this is a likely causal mechanism for the effects seen from AI exposure. The research focuses on the UK and aims to help us better understand whether technology can shape political discourse and threaten democratic institutions. This will help inform how we regulate, highlight, or restrict AI-generated news. I aim to investigate these effects through a simple between-subjects laboratory experiment. My experimental design is summarised in *Table 1*:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Table data with normal content
table_data <- data.frame(
  ` ` = c("Control", "Treatment"),
  `True Articles` = c("Labeled as AI", "No label"),
  `False Articles` = c("Labeled as AI", "No label"),
  check.names = FALSE
)

# Create the table without using footnote()
kable(table_data, align = "l", escape = FALSE, caption = "AI-generated News Control vs Treatment conditions.") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center") %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "AI-generated News Articles" = 2), escape = FALSE) %>% # Bold top header
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE) %>% # Bold the "True" and "False" headers
  column_spec(1, width = "4cm") %>% # Widen the first column
  column_spec(2, width = "4cm") %>% # Widen "True" column
  column_spec(3, width = "4cm") # Widen "False" column

# Manually add a LaTeX footnote below the table
cat("\\begin{flushleft} \\footnotesize Note: Treatment variations to test for interaction effects of veracity, ideological stance, context, and source will be used. \\end{flushleft}")
```

## Draft Survey Questions

These questions will be used to measure the effects of exposure to AI-generated news articles, relative to the control. Questions will be asked pre- and post-exposure to measure changes in attitudes.[^1]

[^1]: An alternative 1-7 Likert Scale can also be used for numerical responses. This has been the case in related AI-based literature, but 0-10 scales are presented below as recommended by YouGov.
