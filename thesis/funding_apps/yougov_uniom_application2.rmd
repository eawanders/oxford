## Research Project and Aims

Machine learning advancements to efficiently handle sequential data inputs and outputs have popularised the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Amongst AI’s applications, generating hyper-realistic textual and visual content has become easily accessible, helping AI become an enabling informational tool. Yet, as unregulated AI technologies remain prone to hallucinations and misuse from bad actors, they are raising concern in social and political contexts. This research project is interested in AI’s capacity to ‘amplify social injustice, erode social stability, […] customised mass manipulation, and pervasive surveillance’ [@bengio2024]. These social and political risks of AI are often discussed anecdotally, but there remains little research nor evidence on what these risks look like. The UK Government's @departmentforsciencetechnology&innovation2025 views ‘manipulation and deception of populations’ a significant threat to political systems and societies; but, the extent to which politically targeted generative AI can be used to distort, deceive, and direct an electorate  remains unclear. Therefore, this project aims to answer:

\begin{quote}
\textit{Does exposure to AI-generated political content increase affective polarisation?}
\end{quote}

After running an initial pilot survey experiment with YouGov, it was found that AI-generated and AI-labelled content did not have statistically significant effect on either thermometer ratings nor trait- and emotional-based attitudes towards the respondents' out-group. However, certain subgroups showed clearly increased affective polarisation measures. To better understand the mechanisms behind these results, and in particular test the emotional and cognitive pathways suggested by the literature, I hope to run a second experiment testing respondents' assignments of particular emotional feelings towards the content in the AI-generated and AI-labelled conditions.


```{r Experiment Design, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Table data with normal content
table_data <- data.frame(
    ` ` = c("Control", "Treatment"),
    `No Labels` = c("Human-generated Article", "AI-generated Article"),
    `Labelled as AI` = c("Human-generated Article", "AI-generated Article"),
    check.names = FALSE
)

# Create the table without using footnote()
kable(table_data, align = "l", escape = FALSE, caption = "Treatments and Control for AI-generated News Exposure.") %>%
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center") %>%
    add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "News Article Labelling" = 2), escape = FALSE) %>% # Bold top header
    row_spec(0, bold = TRUE) %>% # Bold the "True" and "False" headers
    column_spec(1, width = "4cm") %>% # Widen the first column
    column_spec(2, width = "4cm") %>% # Widen "True" column
    column_spec(3, width = "4cm") # Widen "False" column
```

## Draft Survey Questions

These questions will be used to measure whether AI-generated and AI-labelled content triggers statistically significantly different emotional reations that those from the control group.
