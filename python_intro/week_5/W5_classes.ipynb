        "One of the biggest challenges in programming is managing complexity, and *object-oriented programming* (OOP) is designed to address that. By defining *classes*, you can bundle data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) into cohesive units that clearly represent the real-world or conceptual entities in your program. This makes code more readable, easier to extend, and often more intuitive to work with—especially when projects grow large.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, classes are optional—you can write perfectly fine code using just functions and modules—but classes shine when you want to group related data and functionality in one place and leverage features like *inheritance*. This approach lets you create specialised classes that build on existing ones without repeating code. Ultimately, classes help organise and model your program in a logical, human-friendly way, making it simpler for you (and others) to understand, maintain, and reuse what you have written.\n",

Additionally, a class can inherit from other classes, allowing it to reuse and extend existing functionality.
