# Introduction

## Causality

* This week's lecture delved into the concepts of causality and the potential outcomes framework. It discussed causality as the relationship between two sets of events: one (the effects) being a direct consequence of the other (the causes). 

* Our discussion then shifted to the logic of counterfactuals, framed in the context of "If X had or had not occurred, Y would or would not have ensued." This highlights that constructing counterfactuals is essential for making valid causal claims.

* Another key point we covered was the issue of omitted variable bias, which can occur even when some covariates are controlled for. This bias arises from our inability to control for confounders when we lack data on them.


## Potential Outcomes

* We also took an in-depth look at the Potential Outcomes Framework. Central to our discussion was *The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference*, which describes the impossibility of observing different treatment outcomes for the same unit simultaneously. 

* We further examined various estimands, including the average treatment effect (ATE) and the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT).

* The lecture also addressed selection bias, specifically relating to the pre-treatment differences in outcomes between treated and control groups.

* For this week’s practical session, we will revisit some of the core principles of the “potential outcomes” framework and introduce basic applications using R.  


**Before we proceed further:**

1. Create a folder called `lab1`.

2.  Download the data and the empty RMarkdown file (both available on Canvas).

3.  Save both in this `lab1` folder.

4.  Open the Rmd file.

5.  Set `lab1` as the working directory using the `setwd()` function or by clicking on \"More\".

# R Markdown Refresher

If you are struggling to remember how R works since the last time you used it (which is reasonable: coding is like foreign language acquisition, if you don’t use it you lose it), then you might want to check out chapters 1-4 of [this R refresher](https://bookdown.org/ripberjt/labbook/introduction-to-r-rstudio-and-r-markdown.html). More resources are linked at the end of this document, in Section \ref{section:help}. 

`Markdown` is a tool for converting plain text into formatted text. `R Markdown` utilizes the markdown syntax in order to combine formatted text with code in a single document. Within RStudio, R Markdown is a specific type of file format for making dynamic documents. It allows you to simultaneously \newline
1. save and execute code, and 
2. produce high quality documents that include both code and text.
For the purposes of our labs, R Markdown allows us to include code chunks and the text that helps explain them in an easy-to-read manner. You will use R Markdown to write your assignments and the final exam, so it's important that you feel comfortable using the software. 

### Headers

Section headers by using a `#`, for example, `# Section`. Under each of these, you can create subsections, like `## Subheader`, or sub-sub sections, like `### Sub-sub header`. 

### Emphasis

You can add emphasis by making text **bold** or _italic_. To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters. Typing `I just love **bold text**` will produce: I just love **bold text**. To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters: `*italicized text*` shows up as *italicized text* in your output file.

To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add three asterisks without spaces around the letters. If you want to say something `***really important***`, it'll show up as ***really important***! 

### Basic blockquotes

To create a blockquote, add a `>` in front of a paragraph.

> I added the > at the beginning of this paragraph, and got a blockquote :) 

### Multi-paragraph Blockquotes

For multi paragraph blockquotes, in between each paragraph, add a new line with just a `>`.  

> Par 1: The rubber duck, with a sparkle in its eye and a causal inference textbook twice its size, was ready to dive into a world where 'cause' and 'effect' were more than just words in a dictionary.
>
> Par 2: It wasn't the brightest bulb in the chandelier, often confusing correlation with causation, but its enthusiasm could light up the entire department. 
 
### Figures

**Insert an image**

In a new line, type `![Caption for the image](path/to/image.png)`. You can also use `knitr::include_graphics()` within a code chunk, for example:

```{r inserting, echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="A rubber duck doing statistics for me", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rubber_duck_doing_stats.png")
```


**Insert a figure from data**

You can also include figures directly from analysis done within code chunks: 

```{r this-is-a-chunk-label, echo=T, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}

# Data
i <- c(1:4)
Y_i <- c(88, 93, 70, 65)
D_i <- c(1, 1, 0, 0)
Y1_i <- c(88, 93, 67, 65)
Y0_i <- c(91, 98, 70, 65)

# Create a data frame
data <- data.frame(i, Y_i, D_i, Y1_i, Y0_i)

# Create the dumbbell plot
plot <- ggplot(data) +
  geom_segment(aes(y = as.factor(i), x = Y0_i, xend = Y1_i, yend = as.factor(i)), 
               color = "#aeb6bf", linewidth = 1.5, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_point(aes(x = Y0_i, y = as.factor(i), color = as.factor(D_i), shape = "Y0"), size = 4) +
  geom_point(aes(x = Y1_i, y = as.factor(i), color = as.factor(D_i), shape = "Y1"), size = 4) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#009688", "#762a83"), name = "Treatment Status") +
  scale_shape_manual(name = "Potential Outcome", values = c(17, 16), labels = c("Y0", "Y1")) +
  labs(x = "Test Score", y = "i") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_text(size = 14),         
    axis.text = element_text(size = 12),          
    legend.title = element_text(size = 14),       
    legend.text = element_text(size = 12)         
  )

# Potential Outcomes Recap
The following questions are designed to help you get familiar with the potential outcomes framework for causal inference that we discussed in the lecture.

## Task 1.1
Explain the notation $Y_{0i}$.

\(Y_{0i}\) represents the potential outcome for the \(i^{th}\) individual if they are not exposed to the treatment. This outcome is theoretical for individuals who receive the treatment and is only observable for individuals in the control group.

## Task 1.2
Explain the notation $Y_{1i}$.

\(Y_{1i}\) represents the potential outcome for the \(i^{th}\) individual if they are exposed to the treatment. This outcome is observable for individuals who receive the treatment and is theoretical for individuals in the control group.

## Task 1.3  
What is the difference between $Y_{0i}$ and $Y_{i}$? 

\(Y_{i}\) represents the observed outcome for the \(i^{th}\) individual, which can be either \(Y_{0i}\) or \(Y_{1i}\), depending on whether the individual is in the control group or the treatment group, respectively. \(Y_{0i}\) is a specific potential outcome (without treatment) that may or may not be the observed outcome for a particular individual.


## Task 1.4
Can we observe both $Y_{0i}$ and $Y_{1i}$ for any individual unit at the same time?

No, we cannot observe both \(Y_{0i}\) and \(Y_{1i}\) for any individual unit at the same time. This is known as the “Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference.” An individual can either be in the treatment group or the control group, but not both simultaneously.

## Task 1.5 
If $D_{i}$ is a binary variable that gives the treatment status for subject $i$ (1 if treated, 0 if control), what is the meaning of  $E[Y_{0i}|D_{i}=1]$?

\(E[Y_{0i}|D_{i}=1]\) represents the expected value (or average) of the potential outcome without treatment ( \(Y_{0i}\)) for those individuals who were actually treated (\(D_{i}=1\)). It’s a counterfactual average, as it refers to the average outcome that would have been observed for the treated individuals had they not been treated.


## Task 1.6
The table below contains the potential outcomes ($Y_{1i}$ and $Y_{0i}$) and the treatment indicator ($D_{i}$) from a hypothetical experiment with 6 units. 

| $Unit$ | $Y_{1i}$ | $Y_{0i}$ | $D_{i}$ |
|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| 1      | 2        | 2        | 1       |
| 2      | 3        | -1       | 1       |
| 3      | -1       | 9        | 1       |
| 4      | 17       | 8        | 0       |
| 5      | 12       | 9        | 0       |
| 6      | 9        | 1        | 0       |

Complete the following calculations by hand:

1. List the observed outcomes ($Y_{i}$) for the experiment based on the table above. 
The vector of observed outcomes \(Y_{i}\) for the experiment based on the table is \(Y_{i}=(2, 3, -1, 8, 9, 1)\).  
  
```{r}

# Defining the data
Y1 <- c(2, 3, -1, 17, 12, 9)  # Potential outcomes with treatment
Y0 <- c(2, -1, 9, 8, 9, 1)    # Potential outcomes without treatment
D <- c(1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)       # Treatment indicator

# Listing the observed outcomes (Y_i)
Y <- ifelse(D == 1, Y1, Y0)

```



2. Calculate the “true” average treatment effect (ATE) based on the potential outcomes.

The ATE is the average difference in potential outcomes across all units. It can be represented as:

$$ATE = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (Y_{1i} - Y_{0i})$$

Here, $N$ is the total number of units, $Y_{1i}$ is the potential outcome with treatment, and $Y_{0i}$ is the potential outcome without treatment for the $i^{th}$ unit.
  
```{r}

# Calculating the "true" average treatment effect (ATE)
ATE <- mean(Y1 - Y0)

```

The “true” average treatment effect (ATE) based on the potential outcomes is 2.33.


3. Calculate the “true” average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) based on the potential outcomes.

The ATT is the average effect of the treatment on those units that were treated. It is computed as:

$$ATT = \frac{1}{N_{\text{treated}}} \sum_{i: D_i = 1} (Y_{1i} - Y_{0i})$$

Here, $N_{\text{treated}}$ is the number of treated units where $D_i = 1$, and the sum is taken over all these treated units.

```{r}

# Calculating the "true" average treatment effect on the treated (ATT)
ATT <- mean(Y1[D == 1] - Y0[D == 1])

```

The “true” average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) based on the potential outcomes is -2.

4. Calculate the “estimated” average treatment effect based on the naive difference in group means for treatment and control conditions from the observed outcomes. Explain the difference between this estimate and the “true” average treatment effect.

The estimated ATE is based on the observed outcomes and is calculated as:

$$\text{estimated ATE} = \frac{1}{N_{\text{treated}}} \sum_{i: D_i = 1} Y_i - \frac{1}{N_{\text{control}}} \sum_{i: D_i = 0} Y_i$$

In this equation, $N_{\text{treated}}$ and $N_{\text{control}}$ are the numbers of treated and control units, respectively. $Y_i$ is the observed outcome for the $i^{th}$ unit, and the sums are taken over the treated and control groups separately.
  
```{r}

# Calculating the "estimated" average treatment effect
estimated_ATE <- mean(Y[D == 1]) - mean(Y[D == 0])

```

The “estimated” average treatment effect based on the naive difference in group means for treatment and control conditions from the observed outcomes is -4.67. The difference between the “estimated” ATE and the “true” ATE is at 7 and arises due to the fact that the “true” values take into account the potential outcomes of both treated and untreated units, while the “estimated” value is based solely on the observed outcomes.

#  Islam and Authoritarianism

In a famous paper titled “\href{https://doi.org/10.1353/wp.2003.0004}{Islam and Authoritarianism},” Steven Fish asks whether Muslim societies are less democratic.\footnote{M. Steven Fish (2002). “Islam and Authoritarianism.” World Politics, 55 (1): 4-37.} He runs a series of cross-sectional regressions of countries’ *Freedom House scores* (an indicator of the level of a country’s democracy) on characteristics of the countries, including whether they are predominantly Muslim. 

The paper’s dataset is in the spreadsheet `fishdata.csv`, which you can download from Canvas. You should load the data using the `read.csv()` function. This data contains the following variables (among others):

- `FHREVERS` - Freedom House scores, a measure of democracy where higher values indicate that a country is more democratic and lower values indicate greater authoritarianism
- `MUSLIM` - 1 if a country is predominantly Muslim, 0 otherwise
- `GDP90LGN` - the country’s GDP in 1990
- `GRW7598P` - the country’s average annual economic growth from 1975-98, in percent
- `BRITCOL` - 1 if the country was a British colony, 0 otherwise
- `OPEC` - 1 if the country is a member of the OPEC group of oil-exporting countries, 0 otherwise

## Task 2.0
View the first 6 rows of this data. What is the unit of observation?

We can look at the first 6 rows of this data using the head() function

```{r}

f <- read.csv("/Users/tanishamohapatra/Dropbox/CI_HT_2024/Fernando&Tanisha/Week1_Introduction_Causality/fishdata.csv")

head(f)

# What about glimpse?

glimpse(f)

# What about str?

str(f)

# What about view?

view(f)

```

## Task 2.1 
_Taking subsets and summarizing variables_
(Hint: Use square brackets to denote subsets of a variable or dataset. You’ll also need the `length()` function.)


1. How many countries are predominantly Muslim?

```{r}

sum(f$MUSLIM) # Why can we take the sum here?

```


What if the 0s were 2s instead?

```{r}

length(f$COUNTRY[f$MUSLIM==1])

```

What if countries were in the dataset >1 times?

```{r}

length(unique(f$COUNTRY[f$MUSLIM==1])) 

```

Out of 148 countries in the dataset, 44 countries are predominantly Muslim.



2. What percentage of countries are predominantly Muslim?

```{r}

sum(f$MUSLIM)/length(f$MUSLIM) 

```

29.73% of countries are predominantly Muslim.

3. How many countries have a GDP of above 3.0 in 1990?

```{r}

length(f$GDP90LGN[f$GDP90LGN>3]) 

```

88 countries have a GDP of above 3.0 in 1990.

4. How many countries are both Muslim and a former British colony?

```{r}

length(f$MUSLIM[f$MUSLIM==1 & f$BRITCOL==1]) 

```

7 countries are both Muslim and a former British colony.

5. How many countries have either an average economic growth from 1975-98 of above 0.6% or a GDP in 1990 of above 2.5?

```{r}

length(f$GDP90LGN[f$GRW7598P>0.6 | f$GDP90LGN>2.5]) 

```
134 countries have either an average economic growth from 1975-98 of above 0.6% or a GDP in 1990 of above 2.5.


6. Create a new dataset consisting only of countries that are both Muslim and a member of OPEC.

```{r}

f.new <- f[f$MUSLIM==1 & f$OPEC==1,]  # Why do we have to put a comma here?

```


## Task 2.2
What is the difference in mean Freedom House score between Muslim and Non-Muslim countries? Calculate it both by hand and using a regression, verifying that your answers are identical.

```{r}

mean(f$FHREVERS[f$MUSLIM==1]) - mean(f$FHREVERS[f$MUSLIM==0]) ## base R

means <- f %>% ## tidy/dplyr way
  select(FHREVERS, MUSLIM) %>% 
  group_by(MUSLIM) %>% 
  summarise(mean=mean(FHREVERS))
means[2,2] - means[1,2]
2.690455-4.889038  

summary(lm(FHREVERS ~ MUSLIM, data=f))

```
Muslim countries score on average 2.20 points less democratic than non-Muslim countries.



## Task 2.3
Is the difference in means calculated above likely to be biased? If so, in which direction and why?

This is only a bivariate relationship, without any controls. In reality Muslim countries may be different than non-Muslim countries in many other ways that also affect their level of democracy, e.g. their level of economic development. This suggests that the measure is likely to be biased.

Some obvious omitted variables, such as economic development, are likely to be positively correlated with a country’s democracy level but negatively correlated with being predominantly Muslim. This would imply that the difference in means is biased downward, because we have not accounted for the fact that predominantly Muslim countries are also poorer.

Other potential omitted variables are likely to be negatively correlated with the democracy level but positively correlated with being predominantly Muslim, including OPEC membership (and therefore being a major oil-producing country). For instance, the ‘resource curse’ theory in political science suggests that access to oil revenues allows governments to buy off citizens without introducing democracy. Again, this suggests downward bias from having failed to account for the fact that predominantly Muslim societies are also more likely to be OPEC members.

## Task 2.4
Conduct a t-test for the difference in means calculated above using the `t.test()` function. Is the difference statistically significant?

```{r}

t.test(f$FHREVERS[f$MUSLIM==1], f$FHREVERS[f$MUSLIM==0])

```
The difference is statistically significant at any significance level, because the t-statistic is -9.63 and the p-value is extremely close to zero.


## Task 2.5
Conduct the t-test again, this time coding it by hand. Confirm that your answer is identical to the answer you calculated in the question above.

```{r}

d <- mean(f$FHREVERS[f$MUSLIM==1]) - mean(f$FHREVERS[f$MUSLIM==0])
  
se <- sqrt(var(f$FHREVERS[f$MUSLIM==1])/length(f$FHREVERS[f$MUSLIM==1]) +
             var(f$FHREVERS[f$MUSLIM==0])/length(f$FHREVERS[f$MUSLIM==0]) 
           )
  
d/se

```

## Task 2.6
Calculate:

1. The percentage of Muslim countries that are former British colonies
```{r}

length(f$MUSLIM[f$BRITCOL==1 & f$MUSLIM==1]) / sum(f$MUSLIM)

```


2. The percentage of non-Muslim countries that are former British colonies
```{r}

length(f$MUSLIM[f$BRITCOL==1 & f$MUSLIM==0]) / (length(f$MUSLIM)-sum(f$MUSLIM))

```
(Note that steps 1 and 2 are akin to measuring the correlation between being a Muslim country and being a former British colony. We do it this way because a correlation coefficient is defined only for two continous variables, and these are both binary.)


3. The correlation between being a former British colony and Freedom House score, controlling for being Muslim.
```{r}

summary(lm(FHREVERS ~ BRITCOL + MUSLIM, data=f))

summary(lm(FHREVERS ~  MUSLIM, data=f))

```

Use these results to explain the impact that controlling for BRITCOL has on the estimated effect of MUSLIM

15.91% of Muslim countries are former British colonies and 23.08% of non-Muslim countries are former British colonies: The two are negatively correlated. However, the correlation between being a former British colony and the Freedom House score, controlling for being Muslim, is virtually zero. The coefficient on BRITCOL is very small (bearing in mind that the freedom house score ranges from 1 to 7) and not statistically significant. As a result, the coefficient on MUSLIM is virtually unchanged compared to the difference in means we estimated in 2.4 and 2.5. Being a British colony is not an omitted variable here.



Estimate a linear regression with `FHREVERS` as the dependent variable and `MUSLIM` as the independent variable. How do the results from your regression relate to the difference-in-means that you calculated in question 2?


## Task 2.7
Repeat task 2.6 for `OPEC`, `GRW7598P` and `GDP90LGN`. For `GRW7598P` and `GDP90LGN`, simply calculate the correlation between each one and `MUSLIM` and don't estimate the percentages like in steps (i) and (ii).

```{r}
# OPEC
length(f$MUSLIM[f$OPEC==1 & f$MUSLIM==1]) / sum(f$MUSLIM)   # pct muslim countries in OPEC
length(f$MUSLIM[f$OPEC==1 & f$MUSLIM==0]) / (length(f$MUSLIM)-sum(f$MUSLIM)) # or denominator = (sum(f$MUSLIM==0)) # pct non muslim countries in OPEC
summary(lm(FHREVERS ~ MUSLIM + OPEC, data=f)) ## correlation 

# GRW7598P
cor(f$GRW7598P,f$MUSLIM)
summary(lm(FHREVERS ~ MUSLIM + GRW7598P, data=f))
 
  
# GDP90LGN
cor(f$GDP90LGN,f$MUSLIM)
summary(lm(FHREVERS ~ MUSLIM + GDP90LGN, data=f))
 
```
There is a positive correlation between being a Muslim country and being an OPEC member, and a negative correlation between being an OPEC member and democracy, controlling for being Muslim. On the other hand, there is a negative correlation between GDP growth/level in 1990 and being Muslim, and a positive correlation between GDP growth/level in 1990 and democracy. This means that omitting any of these variables will lead to downward bias in the estimated effect of MUSLIM, as explained in 2.3. Including them should lead to the difference becoming more positive (i.e., closer to 0).


## Task 2.8
Now estimate a regression of `FHREVRERS` on `MUSLIM`, `BRITCOL`, `OPEC` and `GRW7598P`. Again, do the results make sense?

```{r}

summary(lm(FHREVERS ~ MUSLIM + BRITCOL + OPEC + GRW7598P + GDP90LGN , data=f))

```

As expected, the coefficient of MUSLIM is now substantially closer to zero. Due to omitted variable bias, our initial difference-in-means estimate greatly exaggerated any negative impact that being Muslim has on a country’s level of democracy. It is very possible that the effect would get closer and closer to zero if we added in even more omitted variables.
